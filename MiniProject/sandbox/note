create unique id for each curve in dataset
plot model to see what the paras are doing
main values are Tlag, Rmax(tan), Nmax(maxium of the capacity)
find a good curve to fit
use a function to get the starting values:
estimate what they should be fit as many points as possible 
use a normal distribution estimate to sample it around the estimated value
